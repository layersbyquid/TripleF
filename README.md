# TripleF
Our project, Triple F helps out obese people to eat healthy and exercise so they can lose weight in a healthy way. 

Our project is useful as it helps obese people lose weight and reduce the obesity rate around the world. 

When a user download our app they would have to first create an account on our app. The app will contain dietary recommendations (certain food to eat), recommended exercises, will let you write about your progress, will let you choose your own routines and lastly have an option if they would like subscriptions for additional recommended dietary regulations and exercises 

We as a whole team are working on the project, and we all have different roles within it.
Shelby: Product Manager (She will be the one deciding what everyone is doing and making sure everyone is on task)
Syed A: Designer (He will be the one sketching the app, designing the app, and helping with the code)
Jonah: Programmer (He will be the one coding our app)
Matthew: Programmer (He will be the one coding our app as well)
Huzaifa: Q&A (Get feedbacks from our users and fix any errors)
